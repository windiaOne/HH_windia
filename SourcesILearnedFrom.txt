I have no clue what I do - just others do. So I thought I share some links I still remember that these helped me to understand.
There is no connection to think they are recommended to help you understand.

business logic
- HH++ script itself, especially for all the game variables
- first contact with "do something in TamperMonkey": https://hibbard.eu/tampermonkey-tutorial/
- start with JS arrays: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp & https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
- - still misses n-dimensional arrays the way I looked for^^

GUI
- create a new button on desired page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6480082/add-a-javascript-button-using-greasemonkey-or-tampermonkey 
- use insertRule to extract style information as CSS: https://www.mediaevent.de/javascript/insert-remove-rule.html
